# Genesis Parent Theme

## Warning: This theme is for testing purposes only!

Genesis Parent Theme is a proof of concept for demonstrating how a standard WordPress parent theme could work with the Genesis Framework if it were converted to a plugin.

See the [Genesis as a Plugin](https://github.com/seothemes/genesis-as-a-plugin) repository for further information.

## Notes

This theme is based on the Genesis Sample theme but a lot of the original files have been stripped out for simplicity.
